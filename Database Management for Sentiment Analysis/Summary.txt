Summary:


Social media is an engaging two-way platform fostering communication amongst the customers and brands/ events. With social media gaining popularity in recent years, it can be leveraged to understand brandsâ€™ perception in the public. Sentiment analysis determines the opinion of customers allowing businesses to optimize their products/ services. Apart from businesses sentiment analysis is helpful in law enforcement, research, education, journalism, entertainment etc. Therefore, with sentiment analysis one can understand the trends, public opinion, engagement to reflect on decision making. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and text classification sentiments are grouped into positive, negative and neutral.
In the scope of this project, a database system will be created to   handle volumes of data for efficient storage, organization and retrieval. A database system ensures high querying, allows cross platform analysis and facilitates easy updation. 

In this project, there would be 8 tables and 2 fact tables as follows:

Main Tables:
i.	Users: Information about social media users (anonymous identifiers).
ii.	Posts: Raw social media posts (content, metadata). 
iii.	Platforms: Details about social media platforms. 
iv.	Hashtags: Track hashtags used in posts.
v.	Keywords: Identify key terms for sentiment analysis.
vi.	Sentiment_Scores: Store sentiment scores for analyzed posts. 
vii.	Languages: Store supported languages. 
viii.	Locations: Record the geographical location of posts.

Fact Tables:

i.	Post_Analytics: Aggregate data for posts (e.g., likes, shares, comments). 
ii.	Sentiment_Trends: Store trends over time (e.g., average sentiment by day).
